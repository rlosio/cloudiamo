# Alexa Skills by http://www.cloudiamo.com (aka Renato) 


These are simple skills that I build during Alexa events in Berlin or to grab a free hoodie from Amazon and try the technology. Nothing fancy and nothing complicated.  

<i>"RaceBase World"</i> is the v1 of the Amazon skill for http://racebase.world/. See "Run Alexa Run" https://cloudiamo.com/2017/07/17/run-alexa-run/
